# Statistical Modelling with Python

## Project Goals
The overarching goals of the project are to practice data analysis
and statistical modelling using Python. Detailed learning 
objectives include, but are not limited, to:

* Accessing data using APIs
* Cleaning and transforming data using Python
* Loading data into a database using Python
* Performing EDA, including using both statistics and visualizations
* Identifying trends and patterns in data using statistical models
* Interpreting the results of the statistical models


## Process
### (your step 1)
### (your step 2)

## Results
(fill in what you found about the comparative quality of API coverage in your chosen area and the results of your model.)

## Challenges 
(discuss challenges you faced in the project)

## Future Goals
1. The limited time and API limits on the free tier of the location services (Foursquare and Yelp)
placed a ceiling on the number of data points that could conceivably be analyzed. As such, the analysis 
was limited to the point of interests in three pre-selected categories that are within a radius
of 1000 m of 300 unique bike stations in Berlin. It would be interesting to
repeat the process with significantly more data points.
2. Model building and data analysis is an inherently iterative process.
Hence, it is important to revisit assumptions made during the data collection and processing
stages, given the outcome of a derived model. As this can directly affect the quality of the model,
more time is needed to improve model accuracy.
3. The decision to harmonize the details collected for each POI was made early in the process.
With more time, relevant details exclusively available in one location provider but that could be reasonably
estimated for the other would be collected, thereby increasing the richness
of the datasets.
4. Raw location data like latitude and longitude of the POIs
can be encoded into more useful forms like postal/zip codes. With such information,
insights about location clusters could enrich the datasets. More time
would allow for such encoding and analysis.
