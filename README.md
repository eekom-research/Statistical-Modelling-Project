# Statistical Modelling with Python

## Project Goals
The overarching goals of the project are to practice data analysis
and statistical modelling using Python. Detailed learning 
objectives include, but are not limited, to:

* Accessing data using APIs
* Cleaning and transforming data using Python
* Loading data into a database using Python
* Performing EDA, including using both statistics and visualizations
* Identifying trends and patterns in data using statistical models
* Interpreting the results of the statistical models


## Process
### (your step 1)
### (your step 2)

## Results
(fill in what you found about the comparative quality of API coverage in your chosen area and the results of your model.)

## Challenges 
(discuss challenges you faced in the project)

## Future Goals
(what would you do if you had more time?)
